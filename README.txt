The Glowmarkt Display and CAD (Consumer Access Display) allows you to see real time usage information from your UK smart meter. This app enables the current electricity usage reading from the Display and CAD to appear as a Smart Meter device in Homey.

Once you have your Display and CAD set up and working with the Glowmarkt Bright app, you can add it to Homey. The Homey device shows current power usage and tariff readings and appears as a Smart Meter in the energy tab. Readings are updated every 10 seconds by default and the polling frequency can be changed in device settings.
